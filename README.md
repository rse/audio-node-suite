About
-----

**Audio-Node-Suite** is a JavaScript library, for use in the Browser
with the [Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/),
which provides a suite of Web Audio API compatible
[`AudioNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode)
classes:

- `AudioNodeComposite`: this is a convenient class for creating
  a custom composite/wrapping `AudioNode` class. It is used internally
  and can be also used for creating your own custom composite/wrapping
  `AudioNode`. As an additional goodie, the class provides a useful
  "by-pass" functionality for temporarily by-passing the effect of the
  underlying `AudioNode` instances.

- `AudioNodeNoise`: this is a white or pink noise generator which
  can be used for testing purposes.

- `AudioNodeMute`: this is a simple node for muting the audio stream.

- `AudioNodeGain`, `AudioNodeCompressor`, `AudioNodeLimiter`: these
  are just convenient wrappers for the regular functionality provided
  by the Web Audio API `GainNode` and `DynamicsCompressorNode` classes,
  providing the `bypass()` functionality and some opinionated parameter defaults.

- `AudioNodeEqualizer`: this is based on the Web Audio API `BiquadFilterNode`
  class and provides a convenient parametric multi-band equalizer `AudioNode`.

- `AudioNodeMeter`: this is based on the Web Audio API `AnalyzerNode`
  class and continuously tracks and measures the overall volume
  in decibel of the audio stream. It is also the internal base
  building block for the `AudioNodeGate`, `AudioNodeAmplitude` and
  `AudioNodeSpectrum` classes.

- `AudioNodeGate`: this is based on the Web Audio API `GainNode`
  class and measures the volume in decibel of the audio stream and
  drains the volume if it drops below a certain decibel threshold. It is
  intended to act as a Noise Gate.

- `AudioNodeAmplitude`: this is based on `AudioNodeMeter` and
  hence the Web Audio API `AnalyzerNode` class to analyze the
  volume level of the audio stream and continuously render
  it into a `Canvas` element in the DOM.

- `AudioNodeSpectrum`: this is based on `AudioNodeMeter` and
  hence the Web Audio API `AnalyzerNode` class to analyze the
  frequency/decibel spectrum of the audio stream and continuously render
  it in a (linear or logarithmic) scale to a `Canvas` element in the
  DOM.

- `AudioNodeVoice`: this is based on `AudioNodeMute`, `AudioNodeEqualizer`,
  `AudioNodeGate`, `AudioNodeCompressor`, `AudioNodeGain` and
  `AudioNodeLimiter` to provide a convenient single `AudioNode`
  which acts as a reasonable filter chain for voice. Its opinionated
  parameters are intentionally hard-coded and are just based on
  experiences of the author.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install audio-node-suite
```

Usage
-----

See the [TypeScript definition](src/audio-node-suite.d.ts)
for details on the provided Application Programming Interface (API).

Implementation Notice
---------------------

**Audio-Node-Suite** is written in TypeScript 4 (ECMAScript 2022) and
is transpiled to plain JavaScript (ECMAScript 2022) and this way runs
in all current (as of 2023/Q1) JavaScript environments, of course. To
support different loader environment, the transpiled output is provided
in the three distinct variants ESM (ECMAScript 2022), CommonJS (Node)
and UMD (Legacy Browser).
